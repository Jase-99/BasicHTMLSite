                    <h2>Background on the dog</h2>
                    <p>
                        The domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. 
                        The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. 
                        The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[8][7] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the 
                        development of agriculture. Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior, 
                        leading to a large number of domestic individuals and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate 
                        for other canids.

                    <h2>The Behavior of Dogs</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) 
                        to internal and external stimuli. As the oldest domesticated species, dogs' minds inevitably have been shaped by millennia 
                        of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have acquired the ability to understand and 
                        communicate with humans more than any other species and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors. Behavioral scientists 
                        have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's 
                        closest canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as great apes, but rather parallel to children's social-cognitive skills.
                        Unlike other domestic species selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. In 2016, 
                        a study found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been 
                        the result of natural evolution and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have 
                        been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response
                        (i.e., selection for tameness) and emotional processing. Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves.
                        Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication 
                        and later in breed formation. Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to 
                        Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem-solving ability.

                    <h2>Health Benifits of Dogs</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dogs suffer from the same common disorders as humans; these include cancer, diabetes, heart disease and neurologic disorders. 
                        Their pathology is similar to humans, as is their response to treatment and their outcomes. Researchers are identifying the genes 
                        associated with dog diseases similar to human disorders, but lack mouse models to find cures for both dogs and humans. The genes 
                        involved in canine obsessive-compulsive disorders led to the detection of four genes in humans' related pathways.

                    <p>
                        The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog's companionship can enhance human physical health and psychological well-being.
                        Studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological well-being have been criticized for being poorly 
                        controlled.It found that "the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their 
                        ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal." Earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better 
                        mental and physical health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians.
